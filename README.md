#Approach taken
* Todo lists are being fetched and stotred in redux.
* Status - "Pending", "in-progress", "Complete" lists are being handeled on the basis of completed- true/false and dividing the list on the basis of length.
* Lists are being displayed on the basic of status and add, edit and delte operation are being managed throgh store.
* Head and sidebar component are completely static for now this can be taken in future enhancements.
* Limitation:- Task Title is not provided in the todo object.
* Future enhancement- The user the task is assigned can be shown. Time required for the task can be added to the card.
