```

* Status - "Pending", "in-progress", "Complete" lists are being handeled on the basis of completed- true/false and diding the list in two.
* Possibly due to this mapping some issue is occuring in darg and drop feature, need to look into this further to make this work.
* Limitation:- Drag and drop feature working on mobile but giving issue on desktop-> Need to refresh on desktop if error occurs
